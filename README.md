# Fetch Snippets for HiGlass's GeoJSON DB

> Load multiresolution images of GeoJSON annotations and store them alongside the annotations for fast retrieval.

Loading image snippets for GeoJSON annotations from OpenStreetMap or Mapbox can be slow as it requires 2 requests: one to the HiGlass server and another one from the HiGlass server to OSM or Mapbox. Since annotations rarely overlap perfectly with a pre-compiled image tile on-the-fly extraction also requires saving the cut out snippet to JPEG or PNG again, which is computationally heavy if the number of requested GeoJSON annotation snippets is high. To alleviate this problem you can cut out these snippets a priori and store them alongside the annotations.

**Note**: This is the source code for loading the GeoJSON annotations only! You might want to check out the following repositories as well if you want to know how to convert and view GeoJSON in HiGlass:
